The topic I have chosen focuses on the Renaissance. The artistic development of the European Renaissance began in Italy in the 14th century and gradually spread across the rest of Europe. Artists shifted away from the formulaic religious symbolism of the Middle Ages toward a human-centered approach to observation and representation, emphasizing human rationality and capabilities. On the first page of my website, I will introduce the origins and development of the Renaissance. On the second page, I will highlight several well-known artists and their representative works, such as The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli. On the third page, I will present some of the most famous Renaissance paintings housed in major museums around the world.
