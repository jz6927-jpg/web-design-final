                    <h3>14th Century</h3>
                    <p>Renaissance art began to sprout in Italy in the 14th century, gradually moving away from the stylized religious images of the Middle Ages and turning to a focus on reality and human beings. The painter began to use light and shadow to shape volume, emphasizing the sense of weight and true emotions of the figures. The composition is more narrative and attempts to create spatial depth. Giotto di Bondona of Florence was a pioneer of Renaissance art. He broke away from the rigidity of medieval painting. Whether in terms of perspective or the use of color, he demonstrated his extraordinary artistic talent. Giotto was popular in his time, and many people imitated his painting techniques. During this period, the perspective technique that Giotto resumed began to be widely accepted.</p>

                    <h3>15th Century</h3>
                    <p>Renaissance art in Italy entered its mature stage, emphasizing rational order and realistic observation. Linear perspective and anatomical research are widely applied, making the picture space more accurate and the proportions of characters more natural. Light and shadow shape volume, and the composition tends to be stable and symmetrical. The artist revives classical elements such as columns, arches and mythological themes, while highlighting human dignity and individual emotions through humanism. Murals, altarpieces and sculptures advanced in parallel, setting a precedent for the "Early Renaissance". The main form of painting in Italian murals in the 15th century was frescoes. Thanks to the sponsorship of the Medici family and under the artistic tradition of the last century, the Florentine School became the most prosperous school of painting in this century. Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus" is the most representative work.</p>

                    <h3>16th Century</h3>
                    <p>Renaissance art reached its peak and became diverse in the 16th century. Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael and others promoted the ideal human body, grand composition and exquisite light and shadow, pursuing harmony, power and a sense of sublimity. The oil painting techniques are more mature, and the colors and air perspective are more delicate. During this period, various schools of painting emerged one after another. The most prosperous school of painting was the Venetian School, while at the same time there was also the Eclectic School of Bologna. Another one is the painting in the Netherlands in northern Europe. This kind of painting is about the subjects of civic life and has a strong realistic style. Among them, the most famous painter is Pieter Bruegel the Elder.</p>
