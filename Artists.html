                        <p>Raphael was an Italian painter and architect during the Renaissance, renowned for his clear forms, harmonious compositions and Neo-Platonic ideals. He was known as one of the "Three Great Masters" along with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. Influenced by Perugino in his early years, he went to Rome to work for the Pope in 1508.</p>
                        <p>He completed important commissions such as the Vatican Frescoes Room, with "The School of Athens" standing as his masterpiece. Though he died young at 37, Raphael produced a rich collection of works characterized by grace, beauty, and perfect balance.</p>
